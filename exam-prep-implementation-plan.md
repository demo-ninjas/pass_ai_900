# Exam Prep App — Implementation Plan

> Use this plan to build an interactive study app for **any** Microsoft certification exam.
> Start a new project for each exam. Replace `[EXAM-ID]` and `[EXAM-NAME]` throughout.
> Each phase builds on the previous one — don't skip ahead.

---

## Phase 1: Research & Scaffold

### Goal
Build the knowledge base from official Microsoft sources.

### Prompt
```
I need to pass [EXAM-ID]: [EXAM-NAME]. My workspace is empty at c:\source\[exam-id].

1. Research the official exam page and study guide on learn.microsoft.com
2. Create a README.md with exam overview, domains, weights, and key links
3. Create a detailed study-guide.md with every exam objective and MS Learn module links
4. Create a study-tracker.md with a day-by-day cram plan using READ → DRILL → RECALL methodology (make it generic — no hardcoded dates, use "Day 1, Day 2" etc. relative to exam day)
5. Create a cheat-sheets/ folder with one detailed cheat sheet per exam domain, including:
   - Exact service names, model names, API parameters, SDK classes
   - REST endpoint patterns and URL formats
   - "Numbers to remember" section (minimums, limits, defaults, timeouts)
   - Decision tables: "when to use A vs B" for every choice the exam tests
6. Create a practice-questions.md with 25+ scenario-based multiple choice questions with answers and explanations

Focus on EXAM-LEVEL detail — exact parameter names, model versions, config values, CLI commands. Not conceptual overviews. The exam tests specifics.
```

### Expected Output
```
[exam-id]/
├── README.md
├── study-guide.md
├── study-tracker.md
├── practice-questions.md
└── cheat-sheets/
    ├── 1-[domain-name].md
    ├── 2-[domain-name].md
    └── ... (one per domain)
```

### Quality Check
- [ ] Every exam objective from the study guide has at least one cheat sheet entry
- [ ] Every cheat sheet has a "Numbers to Remember" section
- [ ] Every cheat sheet has at least one "When to Use A vs B" decision table
- [ ] MS Learn links are real and working
- [ ] Practice questions are scenario-based ("You need to..."), not definitional ("What is...")

---

## Phase 2: Expert Review & Traps

### Goal
Verify accuracy and build the "tricky stuff" content that separates pass from fail.

### Prompt
```
Review all the content we just created with an expert panel approach:

1. Verify all technical claims against the official Microsoft docs. Fix any errors.
2. Create a traps-and-distinctions.md covering:
   - "Sounds the same" service confusions (things easily mixed up)
   - Parameter traps (common wrong answers that sound right)
   - API endpoint traps (different URL patterns per service)
   - Lifecycle traps (what's immutable after creation, what requires rebuild)
   - "When to use A vs B" decision scenarios the exam loves to test
   - Numbers that trip people up (minimums, limits, defaults)
   - The exact format: scenario | correct answer | why NOT the other answer
3. Create a flashcards.md with 130+ Q&A cards across all domains:
   - Cover every "when to choose" decision
   - Include exact model names, parameter ranges, SDK classes, CLI commands
   - Include cards for every trap in the traps file
   - Instructions at top: cover answer column, say answer out loud, star wrong ones
```

### Expected Output
```
[exam-id]/
├── ... (existing files)
├── traps-and-distinctions.md    ← NEW
└── flashcards.md                ← NEW
```

### Quality Check
- [ ] Every "trap" has a scenario + correct answer + "why NOT the other"
- [ ] Flashcards cover all 6 (or however many) domains proportionally to exam weight
- [ ] No factual errors (verified against docs)
- [ ] At least 10 "when to choose A vs B" flashcards

---

## Phase 3: Build the Interactive App

### Goal
Create a single-file study app that works in any browser, saves progress locally, deploys to GitHub Pages.

### Prompt
```
Build a single-file HTML/JS interactive study app (index.html) with a modern dark theme that includes:

1. Flashcards tab — all cards from flashcards.md with:
   - Domain filter buttons
   - Click-to-flip card animation (CSS 3D transform)
   - "Got it" ✓ / "Again" ✗ buttons
   - Auto-star wrong cards, track mastered cards in localStorage
   - "Review Starred" mode for weak cards
   - Progress bar showing position in deck

2. Quiz tab — all questions from practice-questions.md with:
   - Domain filter buttons
   - Choose 10 or 25 question quiz length
   - Immediate feedback with correct answer highlighted + explanation
   - Score shown as pass/fail (≥70%)
   - Wrong-answer review panel after quiz completion
   - Quiz history saved in localStorage

3. Mind Maps tab — one interactive mind map per domain using markmap:
   - Use markmap-autoloader from CDN (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/markmap-autoloader@latest)
   - Set manual rendering mode — render only when user expands a domain
   - Full topic hierarchy matching the cheat sheets content
   - Include all "when to use" decisions as branches in the tree

4. Progress tab — localStorage-based tracking:
   - Cards mastered vs need review per domain (color-coded progress bars)
   - Total reviews count
   - Last quiz score
   - Study streak counter (consecutive days studied)
   - Reset all progress button

5. Cheat Sheets tab — collapsible reference sections:
   - All content from the cheat-sheets/ folder converted to HTML tables
   - Domain filter buttons
   - Click to expand/collapse each section

Requirements:
- Mobile-friendly (responsive, touch-friendly buttons)
- Works offline (no server needed, just open the file)
- No dependencies except markmap CDN
- All data embedded in the JS (FLASHCARDS array, QUIZ_QUESTIONS array, etc.)
- Dark theme, clean UI, smooth animations
- Persistent state via localStorage (prefix keys with exam ID to avoid conflicts)
```

### Expected Output
```
[exam-id]/
├── index.html    ← The app (single file, ~1500 lines)
└── ... (existing files)
```

### Quality Check
- [ ] All flashcards from flashcards.md are in the FLASHCARDS array
- [ ] All practice questions are in the QUIZ_QUESTIONS array
- [ ] All cheat sheet content is in the CHEATSHEETS array
- [ ] Mind maps cover every cheat sheet topic
- [ ] Domain filters work on all tabs
- [ ] Progress persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Looks good on mobile (test at 375px width)
- [ ] Mind maps render when expanded (not all on page load)

---

## Phase 4: Content Sync & Gap Analysis

### Goal
Ensure 100% content synchronicity between markdown files, app data, and mind maps.

### Prompt
```
Do a systematic content audit:

1. Count flashcards, quiz questions, and cheat sheet sections per domain
2. Identify any domain underrepresented relative to its exam weight
3. Check that every "when to choose A vs B" decision in the cheat sheets has a matching flashcard AND quiz question
4. Check every topic in the mind maps matches the cheat sheets (full content synchronicity)
5. Look for topics where we have the "what" but not the "when to choose" — add decision context
6. Look for topics where definitions are too thin for exam-level questions (e.g., "facetable" should explain WHEN to use it, not just what it means)
7. Add missing content to fix ALL gaps found
8. Ensure flashcard IDs are sequential and don't skip
9. Update README with current content counts
```

### Quality Check
- [ ] Flashcard count per domain is proportional to exam weight (±20%)
- [ ] Every decision table in cheat sheets has matching flashcard(s) + quiz Q(s)
- [ ] Mind map nodes match cheat sheet headings 1:1
- [ ] No "thin" definitions remaining — all have "when to use" context
- [ ] README content counts match actual counts

---

## Phase 5: Final Expert Panel Review

### Goal
Catch remaining errors, validate methodology, confirm exam readiness.

### Prompt
```
Final expert panel review across all content:

1. Certification exam coach: Are quiz questions scenario-based like the real exam? Are distractors realistic (wrong answers that SOUND right)? Any missing question types?
2. Cognitive scientist: Does the study method support active recall and spaced repetition? Is the READ → DRILL → RECALL cycle sound? Any methodology improvements?
3. Technical expert: Verify all facts against current Microsoft docs. Flag anything outdated or incorrect. Check exact parameter names, model versions, API paths.
4. UX designer: Is the app mobile-friendly? Any friction in the flashcard flow? Are domain filters intuitive?

Fix everything found. Then give me a summary of:
- Total flashcards, quiz questions, cheat sheet sections, mind maps
- Content coverage per domain vs exam weight
- Any remaining gaps and whether they matter for passing
```

### Quality Check
- [ ] No factual errors remaining
- [ ] Quiz distractors are realistic (not obviously wrong)
- [ ] Study tracker references the app (not stale file references)
- [ ] Study tracker uses generic dates (Day 1, Day 2... not specific calendar dates)
- [ ] All content counts in README are accurate

---

## Phase 6: Ship It

### Goal
Deploy to GitHub Pages and share with team.

### Prompt
```
1. Initialize git repo if needed
2. Push to https://github.com/[org]/pass_[exam-id].git
3. Update README.md with:
   - Link to the live GitHub Pages app at the top
   - Feature table (flashcards, quiz, mind maps, progress, cheat sheets) with counts
   - Full repository file structure
   - "How to Study" section with step-by-step instructions
   - Contributing note
4. Give me a short Teams message I can share with colleagues about the app
5. Give me a prompt I can use to evaluate whether this app + Microsoft Learn combined is superior to Microsoft Learn alone for passing this exam
```

### Post-Deploy
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages: repo Settings → Pages → Source: main, folder: / (root) → Save
- [ ] Test the live URL: `https://[org].github.io/pass_[exam-id]/`
- [ ] Test on mobile
- [ ] Share with team

## Architecture Notes

### Why Single HTML File?
- Zero install friction (just open in browser)
- Works offline (no server needed)
- GitHub Pages deploys instantly
- Works on phone for study-on-the-go
- All state in localStorage (survives page refresh)
- Easy to fork and customize

### localStorage Key Strategy
Prefix all keys with exam ID to avoid conflicts if studying for multiple exams:
- `ai102_starred`, `ai102_mastered`, `ai102_sessions`, `ai102_quizHistory`
- `az104_starred`, `az104_mastered`, etc.

### Content Data Structure
All content lives in JS arrays at the top of the script:
```js
const DOMAINS = [{id, name, weight, color}];
const FLASHCARDS = [{id, d, q, a}];
const QUIZ_QUESTIONS = [{d, q, opts, ans, exp}];
const CHEATSHEETS = [{d, title, content}];  // content is HTML string
const MINDMAPS = [{id, title, color, md}];  // md is markdown string for markmap
```

### Estimated Build Time
| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Phase 1: Research & Scaffold | 15-20 min |
| Phase 2: Expert Review & Traps | 10-15 min |
| Phase 3: Build App | 15-20 min |
| Phase 4: Content Sync | 10-15 min |
| Phase 5: Final Review | 5-10 min |
| Phase 6: Ship | 5 min |
| **Total** | **~60-90 min per exam** |
